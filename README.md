Pandas homework exercise - city schools performance summary

*Note*
When you click on the Jupyter notebook directly from your browser in the repository, it is not displaying the Per Student Budget value correctly. It appears to be concatenating it into the same column as the Total School Budget. I think this may be a bug in the way Github's software displays Jupyter notebooks with this specific type of dataset. 

You should be able to open the notebook in Jupyter and display everything correctly. I attached a screenshot showing this dataframe displaying correctly on my machine.
